# Companion Module Requests
Got a request for a piece of gear, device, hardware or software you'd like to be able control with Companion?

**First**, make sure it hasn't already been created. New modules are created and added all the time, so first download the latest version of Companion and make sure it's not there. New modules will appear in the Companion beta releases first.

**Second**, make sure it hasn't been requested yet. You can check the list of requested but undeveloped modules [here](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-requests/issues).

Ready to submit your request? [Request it here.](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-requests/issues/new)

**Please include with your request:**
* The name of the device, hardware, or software you would like to control.
* What you would like to be able to make it do from Companion.
* Direct links or attachments to the ethernet control protocol or API. Without this, it can be very difficult, *and in some cases, impossible* to fulfill your request.
* Module requests that do not come with enough information may be deleted. This will not happen without some form of response, so please be thorough in your request.

**Guidelines:**
* Commit to being a tester for the module you requested. Make sure you are subscribed to notifications to your request with a method you will check up on.
* If a developer asks a question about your request, provide feedback promptly. Be thorough in your responses.
* Remember, everyone working on this project is donating their time. Please be courteous and respectful.
* If your request has a tight timeline, consider offering a financial reward to speed up development of your module request.
* Consider other ways you can serve the community and project here, like verifying and submitting thorough bug reports, creating documentation, and helping others along the way.
